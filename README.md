We initially started with a dataset with ~52400 movies. However, the genre distribution was skewed towards drama and comedy. To tackle this we tried a couple of options: 
1. Merge multiple datasets to reinforce underrepresented genres
2. Web Scraping
We finally used a hybrid model where we initially combined multiple (3) datasets and web scraping for the genres which were still not sufficiently represented.
